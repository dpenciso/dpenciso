Hi, my name is David Enciso and I am a senior studying Web Development at Utah Valley University. I began coding two years ago afer dabbling in both neuroscience and psychology for a couple of years at Brigham Young University. I have found coding to not only be educational, but fun as I can find solutions to problems I thought were not possible for me to solve prior to knowing code.
